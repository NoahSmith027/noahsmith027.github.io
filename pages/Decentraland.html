                    <a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a> is a browser-based decentralized virtual world game, or metaverse game, that I worked on as a co-op over the summer 2022 term. I worked under MAGIC Spell Studios,
                    a facility at RIT that enables contracting student teams for co-ops. The contracted work I did was for <a href="https://foundrydigital.com/">Foundry</a>, a 
                    subsidiary of <a href="https://dcg.co/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a> to come up with a way to drive more players into Decentraland. To that end the co-op 
                    was not involved with cryptocurrency or NFTs, just designing and developing a space in Decentraland (known as an estate) that is new and exciting. My co-op 
                    term was the first of what will likely be a series of co-ops to fully develop the space, so design and development of base systems was a main priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work on the project as a developer was to design, prototype, and implement gameplay mechanics, controls, user interface elements, and game systems. Much of 
                    this was centered on the first "game" that was being developed on our "estate," which was pinball. Pinball may not sound like an impressive game but Decentraland 
                    has a lot of restrictions due to being a browser-based game. These restrictions include what limited control is permitted by the game's Software Development Kit (SDK) 
                    which does not easily enable many types of games, as well as a strict visual limit (triangles, materials, models, etc) tied to the size of the "estate" you are on. 
                    Due to these limitations and the type of "estates" that are commonly seen in Decentraland, largely being social spaces, a 3D physics-based game like pinball does 
                    not exist. It was also not a regular game of pinball, but large enough to have other players running inside the machine to interact with the game in a different 
                    role, as noted in the gameplay demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is a gameplay demo of what was in the project by the end of the term, along with a more complete model of the pinball machine.</a>.
