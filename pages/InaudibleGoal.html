                    Inaudible Goal is my final project for my Physical Computing class: a class based entirely on embedded programming using
                    an Arduino, along with multiple languages (Arduino [C/C++ based], Processing [Java based], and C#). The
                    basis of the project was to showcase the lack of accessibility options in the games industry, especially
                    in regards to deaf/hard of hearing people, which is what the project focuses on. The goal of the project
                    was that by playing the game, the player would realize just how important accessibility options are in
                    games. The basic gameplay was three levels that were of the same maze-like layout, and to progress the
                    player has to find the goal in each level. But, the goal itself is very difficult to see as it is nearly
                    transparent (hint: it is directly above the player [blue square] at the top of the maze in the gameplay
                    image), yet the player is assisted by an audio cue that increases in pace when the player gets closer.
                    The second level moves the goal and removes the audio cue (simulating deafness), making finding the goal
                    exceedingly difficult. The third level moves the goal again, and this time provides an alternative cue:
                    visual. More LEDs light up the closer gets to the goal. This project uses serial communication between
                    an Arduino and the Unity game engine to pass data about player positioning from Unity to the Arduino.
                    I wrote all of the code for both the Aruino and Unity game.
