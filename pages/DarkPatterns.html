                    Dark Patterns is a group project (The team being called "We're Getting Off Track a Bit" and including me, Jonathan So, Vince
                    DiCocco, and Charley Link) that is being designed to be entered for a co-op opportunity throught MAGIC
                    Studios on RIT campus. The above screenshot is from the first iteration of a project that is currently
                    being overhauled. The inital premise of the game was an entertaining education game that teaches about
                    dark patterns. The definition of dark patterns is: Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps
                    that make you buy or sign up for things that you didn't mean to. This game was being made to teach people
                    of varying ages about these patterns and what to do about them / with them. The game is being changed
                    to be more entertaining as the first iteration of the project was too focused on being educational.

                    My role in Dark Patterns' first iteration was some visual design sections for a mock website. So far towards the newer iteration
                    I have had a large role in the new overall design and narrative.
