                    The Floor is Lava was a semester long project for one of my classes that were made in groups of four. We decided on making
                    a platformer based on the children's game of the same name. My main role for the project was the user
                    interface. I was responsible for making the menus and implementing everything involved with them. This
                    included working on the leaderboard, which saves to a text file, managing the game states, and finding
                    and implementing the sound effect and music. I also had large roles in collision detection, camera alignment,
                    and animation.

                    This project was done using C# with the Monogame library. Source Control was managed with the built in Git connection within
                    Visual Studio. I had to learn how to implement most of the features that I implemented, as user interface
                    elements were not covered much in class.
