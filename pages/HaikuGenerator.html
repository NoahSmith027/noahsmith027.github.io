                    This project, as the name suggests, generates random haikus based on what types of words you want and 
                    has multiple features to better control how the final haiku turns out. You can save individual lines if 
                    you like them and manually change lines if you want to. The export to textarea feature also allows for easy copy/paste 
                    if you want to save a haiku elsewhere. It does have a couple problems though. There is a chance that it might be 
                    a syllable or two off, although this occurs more often depending on word type choices. Manual editing and being able to 
                    re-generate individual lines helps alleviate this problem. Also, while not directly a problem, the project was made 
                    entirely in one html file, which is not the best practice.
                </p>

                    The project was made using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and backbone of the projet: a JavaScript library called RiTa. RiTa is 
                    lexicon and literary analysis library that I used to generate the words used in haikus (taken from RiTa's 40,000 word 
                    lexicon) based on different criteria, such as the amount of syllables.
