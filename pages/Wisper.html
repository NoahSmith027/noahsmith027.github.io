                    Wisper was a gravity-driven 2D platformer made as part of a group of five over a period of five weeks. The game needed to
                    be a mixed media game, meaning that part of the project needed to be digital and part needed to be a
                    physical object(s) that affected the game. The idea that I came up with that was chosen for the project
                    was to use Nintendo Switch controllers (not natively supported on PC) and their built-in accelerometers
                    to affect the game world by changing the direction of gravity. The end product was a platformer where
                    you flicked a Nintendo Switch controller 90 degrees to the left or right or even flip it 180 degrees
                    to rotate the game world in the same direction. Wisper was also optimized so that the rotation mechanic
                    was fluid.

                <p>
                    My work on Wisper was on the controls, mostly button-based inputs although I did also help with the rotation controls, camera
                    movement, physics, and level design. The camera and game physics were not sections that I did alone,
                    but with other members. I made a total of five levels for the game, the hardest of them making up the
                    end of the game's last few levels (only the last of them shown in the video).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I edited the project to make it playable in a browser, available on <a href="https://noahsmith.itch.io/wisper">Itch.io</a>. To make 
                    it playable in a browser the Joy-con controls had to be removed by excluding them from the build using preprocessor directives.
